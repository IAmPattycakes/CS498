/*
To test the word count program you would want to test it on a long file with
all possible issues that could come up. Things such as multiple spaces, weird
unicode characters, and numbers with or without decimal points might end up
adding more words than are necessary, while improper punctuation with no spaces
and hyphenated words may end up lessening the word count below what it should 
be.
